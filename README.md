Do you want to make games with Bevy? Yes?

Do you want to setup Bevy every time you think of a new game? No!?

Well I got the template just for you!

## It's got
- O3 optimizations pre-enabled
- Quick compile times for fast iterations
- A startup system

for a totally unbothered ECS experience!

## Note
This template configures rustc to use LLD which helps improve compile times. This means you'll need to install LLD as instructed here on [Bevy's official book](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/#enable-fast-compiles-optional).  
If you would like to avoid this hassle, you can just delete the .cargo folder in your directory and it will revert back to using Rust's default linker.

Finally, if you think this is missing something, feel free contribute!
